# AI-Camera-Object-Identifier
This is an Ai Camera Object Identifier in which an AI will try to identify the object shown.
The code when run will create a training_data folder in your downloads. If you want to edit the location, refer to the "how to change training_data location". I used chatgpt to help me write it because im too lazy to write it myself lol. 
Every time you run the code, It will add another folder to the original training_data folder.
